Section 1:
Research Question: What factors in countries are related to happiness?
We got the data from Kaggle. The data was collected from the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. 
Cases:
-Country (156)
Variables:
-Social support
-Overall rank 
-Score
-capita
-Healthy life expectancy
-Freedom to make life choices
-Generosity
-Perceptions of corruption
 
Section 2:
Dimensions = 156  8

## Data Dictionary

| overall_rank               | character | Rank (OR1 = Rank) 

| country_or_region      | character | Country (C1 = Country or R1= Region)  

| social_support      | character | Support (SS = Social Support)

| capita            | character | Capita (C1 = GDP per capita)

| life_expectancy         | character | Health (LE1 = Healthy life expectancy)

| freedom         | character | Freedom to make life choices
  (F1 = Freedom)

| generosity       | character | Generosity (G1 = Generosity)
 
| corruption       | character | Corruption (PC1 = Perceptions of corruption)

Section 3:
The outcome would be overall happiness and the predictor would be based on the individual country
The comparison groups we will use is the countries against one another, in order to find patterns in countries and their location based on happiness of the population
Very preliminary exploratory data analysis, including some summary statistics and visualizations, along with some explanation on how they help you learn more about your data. (You can add to these later as you work on your project.)
The method(s) that you believe will be useful in answering your question(s). (You can update these later as you work on your project.)
What results from these specific statistical methods are needed to support your hypothesized answer?

Mean
The mean will allow us to determine if there is an overall trend between happiness and the country a person lives in. This statistical method is simple to calculate and it gives up a good insight on the data.
Standard Deviation
This statistical method will provide a number used to tell how spread out the data is from the mean. If the number is closer to the mean it means that the numbers are close together. Therefore the data is concise and there are little to no outliers.
     3. Regression

A regression model will explain the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable. This analysis will give us an idea whether the relationship between out two variables are either strong or weak.
    4. Sample Size Determination

We will pick a sample from the large data we collected. There are 156 countries we could analyze but we will determine the right size of the sample to come up with accurate results and data. We will calculate the standard deviation for each of the variables and utilize the set of data where it is more consistent or where the data is statistically significant.

## Looking at Countries Happiness

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
happiness <- read_csv("data/2019.csv")
```

```{r}
summary(happiness)
glimpse(happiness)
names(happiness)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
ggplot(data = happiness, mapping = aes(x = Score, y = Perceptions_of_corruption)) + 
geom_point() +
labs(title = "Relationship between Score and Perception of Corruption")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
